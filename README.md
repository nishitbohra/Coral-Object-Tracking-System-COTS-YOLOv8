# Advanced Marine Object Detection

ðŸŒŠ **AI-Powered Marine Intelligence Platform** - A comprehensive solution for underwater environment analysis and marine object detection.

## Overview

This project leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect and analyze marine objects in images, with a focus on Coral Object Tracking System (COTS) detection. The solution features an intuitive dark-themed Streamlit UI and advanced analytics for object counting, confidence analysis, and marine environment monitoring.

### Key Features:
- **Advanced Marine Object Detection**: Detect marine life and other objects in underwater environments.
- **AI Analytics**: Extract insights, including object counts, class distribution, and confidence levels.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Generate confidence heatmaps, count vs confidence scatter plots, and pie charts for object distribution.
- **Streamlit UI**: Easy-to-use web interface for uploading and analyzing images with real-time detection feedback.

## Technologies Used:
- **YOLOv8**: Real-time object detection for marine objects.
- **Streamlit**: For creating a professional, responsive web app.
- **Plotly**: For advanced interactive visualizations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For statistical plotting and data analysis.
